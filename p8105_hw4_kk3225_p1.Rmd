### Problem 1
I worked with Parsons, Faith for problem 1. As a lead, I made the raw data tidy.
```{r}
pups_data = read_csv("./data/FAS_pups.csv", col_types= "ciiiii")%>%
  clean_names()%>%
  gather(key = pd_outcome, value = post_natal_day, pd_ears:pd_walk)%>%
  separate(pd_outcome, into = c("pd", "outcome"), sep = "_")%>%
  select(-pd)%>%
  filter(!is.na(post_natal_day))%>%
  arrange(litter_number)

```
